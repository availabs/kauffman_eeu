Functionality BUGS:

Changing grouping requires selecting two times for graph and table to appear properly
	Likely due to default props/state and when the data loads

Sync'd scrolling between row and table requires loading anything -- IE does not work on initial render	

Display/small BUGS:
Consistent Column size for tables
Get header to show up before click event
If a line is clicked, it should stay highlited until it is clicked again or another is clicked	

TODO on current functionality:

Display row for current selection on both graphs
Finish newfirmper1000 group by state color issue
Dock left side of both tables
on new firm graph, toggle to filter out outlier

TODO new functionality:
rank metro area/state per metric per year separately
also create aggregate ranking (have to determine how to weigh each metric against each other)
	Using rank within the metric as well as the value of the metric itself

EXPLORE:
Explore using 3? year averages to calculate metrics rather than single year to smooth out data
